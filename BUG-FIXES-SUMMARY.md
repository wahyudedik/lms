## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Essay Auto-Grading Not Working** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**File:** `app/Models/ExamAttempt.php`
**Location:** `autoGrade()` method (lines 103-149)

**Problem:**
- Essay questions were completely skipped during auto-grading
- Questions with `keyword` or `similarity` grading modes were not being graded automatically
- Only `manual` mode essays should be skipped, but ALL essays were being skipped

**Original Code:**
```php
if ($question->type === 'essay') {
    $hasEssay = true;
    // Essay questions need manual grading
    continue;  // ❌ This skips ALL essays!
}
```

**Fixed Code:**
```php
if ($question->type === 'essay') {
    if ($question->needsManualGrading()) {
        // Manual essay - skip auto-grading
        $hasManualEssay = true;
        continue;
    } else {
        // Auto-grade essay (keyword or similarity)
        $pointsEarned = $question->calculatePoints($answer->answer ?? '');
        $isCorrect = $pointsEarned == $question->points;

        $answer->update([
            'is_correct' => $isCorrect,
            'points_earned' => $pointsEarned,
        ]);

        $totalPointsEarned += $pointsEarned;
        continue;
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Essay auto-grading now works correctly
- ✅ Keyword matching essays are graded automatically
- ✅ Similarity matching essays are graded automatically
- ✅ Manual essays still require teacher review
- ✅ Status correctly set to 'graded' when no manual essays exist

---

### 2. **Inconsistent Field Names** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Files:** 
- `resources/views/siswa/exams/take.blade.php` (10 occurrences)
- `resources/views/siswa/exams/review.blade.php` (4 occurrences)

**Problem:**
- Views were using `$answer->answer_data` 
- But the model and database use `$answer->answer`
- This caused data not to be saved/displayed correctly

**Fixed Locations:**
1. MCQ Single - saved answer display
2. MCQ Multiple - saved answers array handling
3. Matching - saved matches array handling
4. Essay - textarea value display
5. JavaScript - AJAX parameter from `answer_data` to `answer`

**Impact:**
- ✅ Answers now save correctly
- ✅ Saved answers display properly during exam
- ✅ Review page shows correct student answers
- ✅ No more "undefined property" errors

---

## 🛡️ Null Safety Improvements

### 3. **Missing Null Checks in Question Index Views**
**Files:**
- `resources/views/admin/questions/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/guru/questions/index.blade.php`

**Problem:**
- `foreach` loops on `$question->options` and `$question->pairs` without null checks
- Could cause errors if question data is malformed or incomplete

**Fixed:**
```php
// BEFORE ❌
@foreach ($question->options as $option)
@foreach ($question->pairs as $pair)

// AFTER ✅
@foreach (($question->options ?? []) as $option)
    {{ $option['id'] ?? '' }}
    {{ $option['text'] ?? '' }}
@foreach (($question->pairs ?? []) as $pair)
    {{ $pair['left'] ?? '' }}
    {{ $pair['right'] ?? '' }}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ No more `foreach() argument must be of type array|object, null given` errors
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing/incomplete question data
- ✅ Better data validation and display

---

### 4. **Array Casting Issues in Views**
**Files:**
- `resources/views/siswa/exams/take.blade.php`
- `resources/views/siswa/exams/review.blade.php`

**Problem:**
- Direct `json_decode()` without checking if value is already an array
- Could cause issues if data is already in array format

**Fixed:**
```php
// BEFORE ❌
$savedAnswers = json_decode($savedAnswer->answer, true) ?? [];

// AFTER ✅
$savedAnswers = is_array($savedAnswer->answer) 
    ? $savedAnswer->answer 
    : (json_decode($savedAnswer->answer, true) ?? []);
$savedAnswers = $savedAnswers ?? [];  // Extra safety
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Handles both string (JSON) and array formats
- ✅ No more JSON parsing errors
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing data
